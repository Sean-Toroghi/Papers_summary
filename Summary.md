# <a name = 'rna'>[RNA structure](#up)</a>
The 3d-structure of RNA defines the functionality of RNA. There are a range of methods to explore and idenitify this structure, including experimental (X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy),  computational models. The computational methods are divided into three categories, based on their objective tasks:
1. predicting 3D structure of RNA - three broad methods: knowledge-, physics-, and deep learning- based.
2. identify near-native structures - some type of scoring or energy function model to evaluate structures and idntify most probable ones.
3. refining identified near-native structures
